# Participant List

Final participant list not yet determined.
~~~
<!--
The following runs a function (defined in `utils.jl`) which processes a list of participants from the file `participants.csv` and prints them in alphabetical order.

{{ printlinebyline pages/participants.csv &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;( &nbsp;at&nbsp; )<br>}}

Alternatively, you can just create a manual list:

- Alice Bob, Ph.D. student at University of College
- Zhirayr Avetisian, Professor at University of California, Santa Barbara

etc.
