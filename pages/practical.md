# Practical Matters

### Information
Cambridge is a city in the UK and algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics.

### Funding
The value of modern currency exists only in the collective imaginings of those who use it. Trade, though we do, in the propagation of grand ideas, we have as yet been unable to convince the major economic powers of the world of their deep inherent value -- we have no money. Fear not, for alternative funding sources are available -- prospective participants might consider starting a campaign at [GoFundMe](www.gofundme.com) or ~~~<s>gambling</s>~~~ investing in the [latest cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/) for instance.

### Venue
The conference will take place in the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) at the Center for Mathematical Sciences (CMS), University of Cambridge. Talks will take place in one of the meeting rooms etc etc

### Accomodation
Who knows where everyone will sleep ¯(°_o)/¯ perhaps with enough coffee we won't need accommodation at all

### Travel
Train station at London, tiny terrible awful airport at London Stansted where you have to walk through a single long corridor of overpriced duty free products, etc etc

### Food
Churchill college has a large eating hall conveniently located near CMS. There are many other places to eat in the city center which one can find through the utilization of a modern GPS navigation system. There is grass in front of CMS as a fallback.
